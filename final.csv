Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

G2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors.",7.0,"The simplest, highest quality review vendor, with the best CSM team in the game"

This reviewer was not provided any incentive by G2 for completing this review.,"My biggest hurtle with G2 was the Leads integration. I was told I ""could get the data any way I wanted"" prior to buying. When installing, and realizing it was missing this key feature, I pinged the team. They're still a little young, and therefore overpromised. 

However, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.

The team was fast, effective, and easy to work with during the update; Couldn't be happier.

The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks.

You can track your demo requests from G2C in Salesforce and measure that ROI, but I think the true value of G2C lies in the TOFU brand awareness you get from people viewing your page. And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of ""Comcast LLC viewed your page"") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C.

I don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2.

This reviewer was offered a donation to a charitable cause in their name as thanks for completing this review.,"G2 itself is extremely janky. We had to write up & justify the category that we belong in because G2 didn't understand our industry. We needed to explain why we should or shouldn't be tucked up underneath other categories. We needed to explain, in long-form, why certain companies they identified as our competitors should not even *be* in the category they threw them into.

Talking with Monty, he literally could not even recognize our product category and instead provided to me pages of unrelated market segments. When I gave him the exact page in G2 that I was referring to it said ""I don't have access to live G2 database but I rely on set of structured database information which I currently lack for [my company's category].""

While we had initial traction in getting reviews once we signed the contract, that dried up quickly (after 1-2 months) and then we haven't gotten *any* reviews in the past half-year.

I wish I got sentiment analytics on the page even if someone *didn't* leave a review. I wish there was a way to know how many users were ""watching us"" or whether they had a positive brand sentiment. I can see pageviews, but I wish I could tell if folks were ""subscribed"" to our brand. So we could push updated information to those who had more than passing interest.",,"Good early traction, then fall-off"

Then when you finally do get in touch with them, they are so slow at updating the product profiles that you may as well do it yourself. We worked with them to update our profile and they told us that if we sent updates on all the listings in a single batch, they would do on the backend. That was on May 17th. Now it's June 10th and they have done precisely nothing. By comparison, TrustRadius updated within two weeks. IT Central haven't stopped emailing us weekly to work out how they can help further. Capterra gave us access within days. G2 is asleep at the wheel, their sales team barely responsive.
